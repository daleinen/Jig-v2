I love coding, math, and jigsaw puzzles. So when I saw the youtube video I knew I had to make my own additions. Some of the comments on the video got me thinking about how the badness ration is created and what changes/additions I could implement. Please feel free to fork and come up with your own ideas. E-mail me any thoughts/questions, daleinen@hotmail.com.
