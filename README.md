I love coding, math, and jigsaw puzzles. So when I saw the youtube video I knew I had to come up with something. Some of the comments on the video got me thinking about how the badness ration is created and what changes/additions I could implement. Please feel free to fork and come up with your own ideas. E-mail me any thoughts/questions, daleinen@hotmail.com.

##### Summary
The main additions are the following:
- Add user input functionality
- Run from bash or python
- Add modes, 'user'(new) and 'corporate'(orginal)
- Adjust and rename the 'Badness' scale
